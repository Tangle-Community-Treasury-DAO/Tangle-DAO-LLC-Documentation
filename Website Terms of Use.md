These Terms are governed by and should be construed according to the laws of the Republic of Marshall Islands (without regard to conflict of law rules that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction).

## 7. Dispute Resolution. Arbitration. Waiver of Class Action 

Disputes related to the use of this Site shall be first submitted to mediation. The parties to the dispute shall arrange the terms and procedure for mediation.  

If good-faith mediation of a dispute proves impossible or if an agreed-upon mediation outcome cannot be obtained, all disputes arising out of or in connection with this Site shall be only finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one arbitrator appointed in accordance with the said Rules. No award or procedural order made in the arbitration shall be published. The arbitrator shall apply the governing law of this agreement pursuant to Article 21.3. The language of the arbitration will be English. This clause will prevail over any other clause or principles of law which may establish a different jurisdiction for the disputes arising out or in connection with the use of this Site.  

All claims and disputes within the scope of the aforementioned arbitration agreement must be arbitrated individually and not on a representative or collective class basis. Only individual relief is available, and claims of more than one user, person, or entity cannot be arbitrated or consolidated with those of any other user, person, or entity. Accordingly, under the arbitration procedures outlined in this section, an arbitrator shall not combine or consolidate more than one party’s claims without the written consent of all affected parties to an arbitration proceeding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you and the Tangle DAO LLC Agree that no dispute shall proceed through class arbitration without the written consent of all affected parties.  

## 8. Minors – add in paragraph – 

Persons younger than the age of 18 are considered minors and must be under the care of a parent or guardian unless they are emancipated.
